Amid the ongoing conflict between Gaza and Palestine, Israeli government websites have faced intense cyberattacks. These attacks have been orchestrated by various hacktivist groups, including **Team Azrael Angel Of Death, Beluga, Xargai, Sharkistan, Hacktivist Indonesia** and more. They have disrupted services and led to security breaches, resulting in the public exposure of official credentials such as usernames and passwords for government websites.

Notably, several domains, including the Israel Marine Server, Rafael Advanced Defense System, public.eca.gov.il, kolnessziona.co.il, and many others, have been brought down. As tensions persist, these hacktivist groups show no signs of slowing down and plan to further intensify their cyberattacks.
