**Note:** As of now, nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack!

Ongoing Israeli oppression and violence in Palestine have sparked global outrage and protests. The unity of voices against these actions underscores the demand for change. This environment has also seen a rise in cyber attacks against the responsible entities.
