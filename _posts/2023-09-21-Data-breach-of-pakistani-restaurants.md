In a significant cyber breach, data from 2.2 million Pakistani citizens has been hacked and is now available for sale online. The hackers claim to have successfully infiltrated databases from over 250 restaurants. This stolen data includes sensitive information like contact numbers, credit card details, and email addresses, putting those affected at risk of financial fraud and identity theft. Shockingly, this compromised data, along with payment histories, is being offered for purchase online at a price of 2 Bitcoins, equivalent to about $54,000 or Rs15 million in Pakistani currency.

The hacked software responsible for the data compromise comes from a private company known as Indolj. The hackers have even provided a sample of the stolen data publicly exposing emails of customers, highlighting the urgency of addressing this cyber threat. Despite the scale of the breach, it's surprising that the Federal Investigation Agency's (FBR) cybercrime division has not yet received any official complaints regarding this incident, raising concerns about the need for swift action to protect those affected.
